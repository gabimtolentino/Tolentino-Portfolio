Professional Portfolio
This is my second HW challenge! I am creating a personal portfolio.
I put into practice everything I have learned so far in html and css.
Some of these things include flexbox layout, responsive design, and box styling.
I added a portfolio profile picture.
I made use of links and navigating them.
